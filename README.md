# E07b-Procedural-Generation

This is an assignment from my Game Technology course where we experimented with procedural generation. The goal of the anignment was to make a code that randomly generates a maze. It was taken from the [KidsCanCode's exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YShYWaGF3Nc) so you can learn more about it there.
